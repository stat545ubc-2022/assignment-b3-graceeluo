# Assignment B-3 and B-4

The purpose of this application is to allow users to interact, evaluate, and visualize the data from the BC Liquor data set. This data set includes information on the liquor's type, subtype, country, name, alcohol content, price and sweetness. 

**Assignment B-3: Option A** - BC Liquor app was completed for Assignment B-3. The Shiny App can be accessed through the following link: https://graceeluo.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-graceeluo/

Four additional features have been added to the "basic" version of the app:
* Feature 1: Using the _shinythemes_ package, the theme "spacelab" was added to make the app more visually appealing. 
* Feature 2: An image of the BC Liquor Store logo was added to the UI to improve the overall aesthetic of the app. 
* Feature 3: Tabs of Histogram and Data Table were added to improve organization of the app. 
* Feature 4: Using the _DT_ package, the static table was turned into an interactive table to allow searching, paging and sorting abilities. 

**Assignment B-4; Option C** - Shiny App was completed for Assignment B-4. Additional features were implemented to the Shiny App from Assignment B-3. The Shiny App can be accessed through the following link: https://graceeluo.shinyapps.io/assignment-b4-graceeluo/

Three additional features have been added to the version of the app from Assignment B-3: 
* Feature 5: The "Product Type" side panel was changed to allow users to search for multiple entries simultaneously. For example, search for multiple alcohol types at once instead of wine/beer/etc, one at a time.
* Feature 6: An option to sort the Data Table by price was added to allow users to view the data from least expensive to most expensive
* Feature 7: The "Download Results" button was added to allow users to download the Data Table as a csv file for the purpose of data analysis or future use
